# Strategic Prioritization

## Prioritization Frameworks

### 1. RICE Scoring
- **Reach**: How many users/customers will this impact?
- **Impact**: How much will it impact each user?
- **Confidence**: How confident are we in our estimates?
- **Effort**: How much time/resources will it take?

```
RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) ÷ Effort
```

### 2. Value vs Effort Matrix
- High Value, Low Effort: Quick Wins
- High Value, High Effort: Strategic Projects
- Low Value, Low Effort: Fill-Ins
- Low Value, High Effort: Time Sinks

### 3. Kano Model
- **Basic Features**: Must-have functionality
- **Performance Features**: Better = More satisfied
- **Excitement Features**: Unexpected delight
- **Indifferent Features**: Neither satisfaction nor dissatisfaction
