## Architecture

Tahecho uses a multi-agent system built with LangChain and LangGraph:
- **Manager Agent**: Orchestrates and routes tasks using LangGraph workflow
- **Task Classifier**: Determines which agent should handle each request (Jira vs general)
- **Jira MCP Agent**: Handles all Jira operations using MCP Atlassian server

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management (**REQUIRED** - all commands must use Poetry)
- Jira Cloud account with API access
- OpenAI API key
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for MCP server management (installed automatically)

### Quick Start

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Always use `poetry run` for all commands to ensure the correct Python environment and dependencies.**

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd tahecho
   ```

2. **Install Poetry and dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install Poetry if you don't have it
   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
   
   # Install project dependencies with Poetry
   poetry install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your actual values
   ```
   
   Create a `.env` file in the project root with these **required** variables:
   ```bash
   # OpenAI API Key (required)
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

   # Jira Configuration (required for Jira functionality)
   JIRA_INSTANCE_URL=https://your-domain.atlassian.net
   JIRA_USERNAME=your_email@domain.com
   JIRA_API_TOKEN=your_jira_api_token
   JIRA_CLOUD=True
   ```

4. **Test your setup** (use Poetry!)
   ```bash
   poetry run pytest tests/smoke/test_setup.py -v
   ```

5. **Start the MCP-Atlassian server** (required for Jira integration)
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Use the helper script (recommended)
   poetry run python scripts/setup_mcp_jira.py
   
   # Option 2: Start manually (must have uv installed)
   uvx mcp-atlassian
   ```

6. **Run the application** (use Poetry!)
   ```bash
   # Standard mode (recommended)
   poetry run chainlit run app.py
   
   # For development with auto-reload
   poetry run chainlit run app.py --watch
   
   # With debug mode and custom port
   poetry run chainlit run app.py --watch --debug --port 8001
   ```

### How It Works

Tahecho provides streamlined Jira operations through:
- **Direct Jira operations** via MCP agent
- **Natural language queries** for ticket management
- **Task creation and updates** with simple commands
- **JQL query support** for advanced filtering

### Development Setup

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Use Poetry for ALL commands to ensure correct dependencies and Python environment.**

1. **Poetry manages the virtual environment automatically - no need to create one manually**
   ```bash
   # Poetry creates and manages the virtual environment for you
   poetry install  # This installs dependencies in Poetry's managed environment
   ```

2. **Verify Poetry environment**
   ```bash
   # Check which Python Poetry is using
   poetry env info
   
   # Run commands in Poetry environment (always use this pattern)
   poetry run python --version
   ```

3. **Run the application** (always with Poetry!)
   ```bash
   poetry run chainlit run app.py
   ```

## Jira MCP Integration

Tahecho uses the [MCP Atlassian server](https://github.com/sooperset/mcp-atlassian) to provide seamless integration with Jira. 

### Setup Requirements

**IMPORTANT**: You must start the MCP-Atlassian server before using Jira features:

```bash
# Make sure your .env file contains your Jira credentials:
# JIRA_INSTANCE_URL=https://your-company.atlassian.net
# JIRA_USERNAME=your.email@company.com
# JIRA_API_TOKEN=your_api_token

# Start the MCP server (it reads from .env automatically)
uvx mcp-atlassian
```

Keep this server running in a separate terminal while using Tahecho.

### Supported Operations
- **Search tickets**: Find tickets assigned to you or in specific projects
- **Create tickets**: Generate new tasks, bugs, or stories
- **Get ticket details**: Retrieve comprehensive information about specific tickets
- **Update tickets**: Modify status, assignees, and other fields
- **JQL queries**: Use Jira Query Language for advanced filtering

### Example Queries
```
User: What tickets are assigned to me?
Assistant: You currently have 3 tickets assigned to you:
1. PGA-123: Implement new feature (In Progress)
2. PGA-456: Fix bug in login (To Do)  
3. PGA-789: Review documentation (Done)

User: Please create a new ticket in project PGA with the content: Implement user authentication feature
Assistant: Successfully created ticket PGA-124: Implement user authentication feature

User: Show me all tickets in the PGA project
Assistant: Here are the current tickets in the PGA project:
1. PGA-123: Implement new feature - Status: In Progress
2. PGA-456: Fix bug in login - Status: To Do
[... additional tickets]
```

### MCP Server Requirements
The integration automatically manages the MCP Atlassian server, but requires:
- Valid Jira Cloud credentials in your `.env` file
- Network access to your Jira instance
- The `uv` package manager (installed automatically with Poetry)

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required | Default |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI API key for LLM access | Yes | - |
| `JIRA_INSTANCE_URL` | Jira Cloud instance URL | Yes | - |
| `JIRA_USERNAME` | Jira username/email | Yes | - |
| `JIRA_API_TOKEN` | Jira API token | Yes | - |
| `JIRA_CLOUD` | Set to "true" for Jira Cloud | Yes | True |

### Configuration Options

All configuration is done through the `.env` file with the variables listed above.

## Testing and Diagnostics

### Test Setup

**‚ö†Ô∏è ALWAYS use Poetry for tests to ensure correct Python environment:**

```bash
# Run comprehensive setup test (MUST use Poetry!)
poetry run pytest tests/smoke/test_setup.py -v

# Run all unit tests (MUST use Poetry!)
poetry run pytest tests/unit/ -v

# Run all tests (MUST use Poetry!)
poetry run pytest -v

# Run tests with coverage (MUST use Poetry!)
poetry run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run specific test categories (MUST use Poetry!)
poetry run pytest tests/unit/ -v          # Unit tests
poetry run pytest tests/integration/ -v   # Integration tests
poetry run pytest tests/smoke/ -v         # Smoke tests
```

### Troubleshooting

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: All troubleshooting commands MUST use Poetry to work correctly.**

**App Won't Start:**
1. Verify all required environment variables are set
2. Check OpenAI API key is valid
3. Ensure Jira credentials are correct
4. Run diagnostic script: `poetry run pytest tests/smoke/test_setup.py -v`
5. Verify Poetry environment: `poetry env info`



**Jira MCP Issues:**
If Jira operations fail:
1. Verify Jira credentials are correct in `.env`
2. Test MCP server setup: `poetry run python scripts/setup_mcp_jira.py`
3. Check network connectivity to your Jira instance
4. Ensure `uv` is installed: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`

**Module Import Errors - THE MOST COMMON ISSUE:**
If you get `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tahecho'`:
- **ALWAYS use `poetry run` prefix for ALL commands**
- ‚úÖ Correct: `poetry run chainlit run app.py`
- ‚ùå Wrong: `chainlit run app.py` (will fail)
- ‚úÖ Correct: `poetry run pytest tests/`
- ‚ùå Wrong: `pytest tests/` (will fail)
- ‚úÖ Correct: `poetry run python script.py`
- ‚ùå Wrong: `python script.py` (will fail)

**Poetry Environment Issues:**
```bash
# Check Poetry is managing the right environment
poetry env info

# Rebuild Poetry environment if needed
poetry env remove python
poetry install

# Always run commands through Poetry
poetry run python --version  # Should show Python 3.11+
```

## Development Workflow

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

We follow the **Red-Green-Refactor** cycle:

1. **Red**: Write a failing test
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to make the test pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve the code while keeping tests green

### Running Tests

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: ALL test commands MUST use Poetry - this is non-negotiable for correct operation.**

```bash
# Run all tests (MUST use Poetry!)
poetry run pytest

# Run with coverage (MUST use Poetry!)
poetry run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run specific test categories (MUST use Poetry!)
poetry run pytest tests/unit/          # Unit tests
poetry run pytest tests/integration/   # Integration tests
poetry run pytest tests/smoke/         # Smoke tests

# Test Jira MCP integration specifically (MUST use Poetry!)
poetry run python scripts/test_jira_integration.py

# Run tests in watch mode (MUST use Poetry!)
poetry run ptw

# Run tests with verbose output (MUST use Poetry!)
poetry run pytest -v

# Run tests with specific markers (MUST use Poetry!)
poetry run pytest -m unit      # Only unit tests
poetry run pytest -m jira      # Only Jira-related tests
poetry run pytest -m mcp       # Only MCP-related tests
```

### Test Structure

```

### Writing Tests

**Unit Test Example:**
```python
def test_task_classifier_mcp_task():
    """Test that Jira-related tasks are classified as MCP tasks."""
    # Arrange
    classifier = TaskClassifier()
    state = create_initial_state("Show me all open bugs in DTS project")
    
    # Act
    result_state = classifier.classify_task(state)
    
    # Assert
    assert result_state.task_type == "mcp"
```

**Integration Test Example:**
```python
def test_mcp_agent_creates_jira_issue():
    """Test that MCP agent can create a Jira issue."""
    # Arrange
    agent = LangChainMCPAgent()
    state = create_initial_state("Create a new task called 'Test Task' in project DTS")
    
    # Act
    result_state = agent.execute(state)
    
    # Assert
    assert "created" in result_state.agent_results["mcp_agent"].lower()
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

Install pre-commit hooks for code quality:
```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

This will run:
- Black (code formatting)
- isort (import sorting)
- flake8 (linting)
- mypy (type checking)
- pytest (tests)

### Code Quality

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Use Poetry for all code quality tools to ensure consistent environment.**

```bash
# Format code (use Poetry!)
poetry run black .
poetry run isort .

# Lint code (use Poetry!)
poetry run flake8
poetry run mypy .

# Run all quality checks (use Poetry!)
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files

# Install pre-commit hooks (use Poetry environment)
poetry run pre-commit install
```

## Running the Application

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: ALWAYS use `poetry run` to start the application - this is mandatory.**

### Local Development
```bash
# Standard mode (MUST use Poetry!)
poetry run chainlit run app.py

# Development mode with auto-reload (MUST use Poetry! - recommended for development)
poetry run chainlit run app.py --watch

# Development with debug mode and custom port (MUST use Poetry!)
poetry run chainlit run app.py --watch --debug --port 8001

# Check Poetry environment before running
poetry env info  # Verify Python version and path
```

**‚ùå NEVER run these commands (they will fail):**
```bash
# These will NOT work and will give ModuleNotFoundError:
chainlit run app.py           # ‚ùå Missing poetry run
python app.py                 # ‚ùå Missing poetry run
uvicorn app:app              # ‚ùå Missing poetry run
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:8000

**üí° Development Tip:** Use the `--watch` flag to automatically reload the app when you make code changes - no need to stop and restart manually!

### Stop the Application
```bash
Ctrl+C
```
